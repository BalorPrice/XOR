INTRODUCTION

This is a Sam Coupé conversion of the Spectrum/BBC game by Astral/Logotron 1987.
Nothing has been reverse-engineered, I started from scratch.

Standard disclaimer - this game is public domain, and comes without any warranty 
of any kind, have fun.  It runs on SimCoupé so the worst damage you can do is 
crash an emulator or beermat a 3.5" floppy.


THE OBJECTIVES OF THE GAME

To complete all 15 levels!! As you go through the door of each level you will
be given a letter, note down these letters. These letters will make up an
encrypted clue to XOR's true nature. By the way you cannot pass through the
door until you have collected all of the masks at each level.

In your exploration of the mazes you will encounter falling fish, two kinds of 
force field, spring loaded chickens, fizzer bombs and pressure bombs, BMUS 
(Beam Me Up Scottie), dolls, doors, maps and masks which are not always quite what 
they seem.

We won't tell you any more - because the fun of the game is in discovering the
properties of these different features! Needless to say, you often need both
your shields. The levels are graded and the bottom levels are suicidal!


PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS

Convert the disk image to a physical image using your favourite conversion 
software, or use a SAM Coupé emulator like SIMcoupe.

F9 TO LOAD (numerical pad 9 on an emulator).

To select a maze, move up and down the list of mazes using your joystick or
keyboard controls (see below) and press SPACE/FIRE at your desired selection.

You can play each level as many times as you like, which is to say, you may die
several times in your quest to discover the nature of XOR :)

KEYBOARD CONTROLS

O move to the LEFT
P move to the RIGHT
Q to move UP
A move DOWN

SPACE or joystick FIRE switch to alternate Hero
CURS UP to toggle between Maze and Map
Esc to Quit current maze
Y/N for action replay/restart

The number of masks to be collected, the number of masks you have already
collected and the moves to date are shown in windows on the play screen.  Play
is limited to 2000 moves per level.  Only one shield will go through the exit door,
and although it is possible  to complete some levels with one shield remaining,
should you lose a shield early in an attempt completing the level may become
impossible.



That's all I can think of for now.  Have fun!
