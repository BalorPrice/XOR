THE OBJECTIVES OF THE GAME
To complete all 15 levels!! As you go through the door of each level you will
be given a letter, note down the 15 letters. These letters will make up an
encrypted clue to XOR's true nature. By the way you cannot pass through the
door until you have collected all of the masks at each level.

Note that you cannot enter mazes 11, 13, and 15 until you have completed levels
10, 12 and 14 respectively. In your exploration of the mazes you will
encounter falling fish, two kinds of force field, spring loaded chickens,
fizzer bombs and pressure bombs, BMUS (Beam Me Up Scottie), dolls, doors, maps
and masks which are not always quite what they seem.

We won't tell you any more - because the fun of the game is in discovering the
properties of these different features! Needless to say, you often need both
your shields. The games are graded and the bottom levels are suicidal!

PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
XOR will confront you while the program loads. Press any key to exit the
subsequent scenario scene.

For SPECTRUM users- to select the appropriate joystick interface or keyboard,
press the number corresponding to your desired choice and then press RETURN.

Note that the following joystick interfaces are supported: KEMPSTON, PROTEK,
SINCLAIR (port 1).

For AMSTRAD and COMMODORE users, the joystick and keyboard work simultaneously.

To select a maze, move up and down the list of mazes using your joystick or
keyboard controls (see below) and press RETURN at your desired selection.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
X move to the LEFT
Z move to the RIGHT
P Spectrum, [ Amstrad, ; Commodore to move UP
L Spectrum, ; Amstrad, / Commodore to move DOWN
RETURN or joystick FIRE switch to alternate Hero
M for SPECTRUM and AMSTRAD users to toggle between Maze and Map
E to Exit current maze
Y/N for action replay/restart
H to hold action (during replay)
Space bar to single step through action (during replay)
O to switch sound on/off

The number of masks to be collected, the number of masks you have already
collected and the moves to date are shown in windows on the play screen.

If you solve all 15 levels you qualify to become a Member of the Order of XOR,
with a certificate and badge to prove it.
